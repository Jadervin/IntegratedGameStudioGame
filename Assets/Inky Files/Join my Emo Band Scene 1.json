She's innocent after all. Phew. Six solved cases in one day, that's got to be a new record. Heh, I should give myself a raise.","\n",{"#":"Name Ariar:"},"^Hey boss, I got the information to the constables. They'll make an arrest by the end of the night.","\n",{"#":"Name MC:"},"^Which case was that for?","\n",{"#":"Name Ariar:"},"^The cat that was stolen out of the tree. Poor old lady was horrified. She thought they were helping her, but they just ran off with the cat.","\n",{"#":"Name MC:"},"^That's good news. That case was weighing on my mind all last night, couldn't sleep a wink.","\n",{"#":"Name Ariar:"},"^I didn't take you for a cat lover.","\n",{"#":"Name MC:"},"^I'm an empath for all living creatures.","\n",{"#":"Name Ariar:"},"^Oh, also, I picked up a few new cases from House Cherry Blossom. Our Lord is making efforts to lower the crime rates in the land, and as such, every minor case is being treated far more seriously.","\n",{"#":"Name MC:"},"^That's good, I think? I can get to those tomorrow. I'm tired.","\n",{"#":"Name Ariar:"},"^No worries, you've been working yourself hard today. You know, House Cherry Blossom could really use a talented investigator like you.","\n",{"#":"Name MC:"},"^Why would they need me when they have you in the family?","\n",{"#":"Name Ariar:"},"^Never a shortage of talent to be had. The more people on board, the more people we can help.","\n",{"#":"Name MC:"},"^You know my stance on Houses, Ariar.","\n",{"#":"Name Ariar:"},"^Yeah, yeah, you're all about staying neutral. I get that. What's that thing you always say: 'wherever you wander, wherever you roam....' No, that's not it. Ah, yes, 'One in distress can be saved, a house in distress cannot.' I understand, but if you ever do decide to join a House, We'd, I mean, I'd love to have you with us.","\n",{"#":"Name MC:"},"^How about you give me your sales pitch after we've finished locking up for the night. We'll go to Trello Tavern and you can give it another shot.","\n",{"#":"Name Ariar:"},"^Fine, but you should know, I'm being completely serious. You're wasted in your neutrality.","\n",{"#":"Name MC:"},"^[holds up finger, waving sternly] A-ba-bah-bah! Save it for Trello's! Now can you turn off the lights? I'll get the door.","\n","^There is sudden knocking at the door. A letter is slid under the door. It is marked with an urgent notice.","\n",{"#":"Name MC:"},"^What in the-","\n",{"#":"Name Ariar:"},"^What is that?","\n",{"#":"Name MC:"},"^Some sort of letter. It says it's urgent.","\n",{"#":"Name Ariar:"},"^Well in that case, let's open it.","\n","^MC opens the letter","\n",{"#":"Name MC:"},"^That's strange.","\n",{"#":"Name Ariar:"},"^What does it say?","\n",{"#":"Name MC:"},"^Nothing, really. It's just an address and one word: Help. I don't know if we should trust this or not. What if it's a trap?","\n",{"#":"Name Ariar:"},"^But what if it's not? You should go. I'll stay behind just in case something bad happens, you can call me.","\n",{"#":"Name MC:"},"^I'm not sure about this.","\n",{"#":"Name Ariar:"},"^Nor am I, but don't worry, how many times have I let you die?","\n",{"#":"Name MC:"},"^Well considering I'm still alive...","\n",{"#":"Name Ariar:"},"^Right, you can trust me.","\n",{"#":"Name MC:"},"^I just want to stay that way. But what if you are right, and something truly if wrong. What if someone needs help, and I didn't come to their aid? If something bad does happen, and I could have helped, I don't know if I could live with that. Okay, I'll go. But be ready for my call in case I'm the next one with an urgent call for help.","\n",["done",{"#f":5,"#n":"g-0"}],null],"done",{"#f":1}],"listDefs":{}}
