It's been a mess for all of our citizens. We just hope we're doing enough to keep them safe for the time being.","\n",{"#":"name lilhelm"},{"#":"sprite LilhelmIdle"},"^Yes, the safety of our people is of the upmost importance.","\n",{"#":"name Crell-Trillo"},{"#":"sprite CrellTrilloIdle"},"^How are you doing?","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^Me? Oh, I'm fine, thank you for asking. How is your resource distribution going with all of this? Do you have enough to sustain your house?","\n",{"#":"name lilhelm"},{"#":"sprite LilhelmIdle"},"^Our resources have been greatly damaged. Our food supply has been greatly weakened. You see, us Slimes have relied on magic for our crop maintenance. Without it, our food grows much slower.","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^I am sorry to hear this.","\n",{"#":"name Crell-Trillo"},{"#":"sprite CrellTrilloIdle"},"^Since you are here, perhaps you can provide an outside perspective in regards to some ongoing discussions.","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^Happily. What's up?","\n",{"#":"name Crell-Trillo"},{"#":"sprite CrellTrilloIdle"},"^Well, since farming is much slower now, most farmers have had to find new jobs to make enough money.
