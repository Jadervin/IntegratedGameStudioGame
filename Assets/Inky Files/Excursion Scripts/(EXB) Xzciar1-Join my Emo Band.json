You can thank Aether for that.","\n",{"#":"name Xzciar"},{"#":"sprite XzciarIdle"},"^What was it like?","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^Pardon?","\n",{"#":"name Xzciar"},{"#":"sprite XzciarIdle"},"^I mean, like, what did it feel like to be relentlessly attacked by Philel?","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^Oh.","\n",{"#":"name Xzciar"},{"#":"sprite XzciarIdle"},"^Sorry. That's not a fair question.","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^It's okay.","\n",{"#":"name Xzciar"},{"#":"sprite XzciarIdle"},"^I guess I'm just glad that it wasn't me.","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^Yes, I regret that it had to be me.","\n",{"#":"name Xzciar"},{"#":"sprite XzciarIdle"},"^Yeah, no kidding. I hope it didn't hurt too bad.","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^It was the most pain I have ever experienced.","\n",{"#":"name Xzciar"},{"#":"sprite XzciarIdle"},"^Right.

Might I ask: if you didn't want to fight, how did you end up in the army for House Spider-Lily?","\n",{"#":"name Xzciar"},{"#":"sprite XzciarIdle"},"^Well, capable warriors were in high demand. Unfortunately, I just so happened to be one of them. So I didn't really have a choice.","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^So you are a talented fighter, yet you didn't want to fight?","\n",{"#":"name Xzciar"},{"#":"sprite XzciarIdle"},"^Exactly. Does that make sense.","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^Of course it does. One shouldn't be forced to only do that which they are most capable of doing. Ambition and talent are two very different things, but to those few whose ambitions and talents do align, there is great potential.","\n",{"#":"name Xzciar"},{"#":"sprite XzciarIdle"},"^I agree. Everyone kept telling me that I had to fight. I was good at it, so that was the only thing I should think about doing. As if my talent was a naturally calling that defined my ambitions. I want to do what I want to do. Not what others think best for me to do.","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^I understand that far more than you could imagine.","\n",{"#":"name Xzciar"},{"#":"sprite XzciarIdle"},"^So tell me, did I make the right choice to avoid the fight, even though my house will certainly not forgive me?","\n",{"->":"Choices"},["done",{"#f":5,"#n":"g-0"}],null],"done",{"Choices":[[["ev",{"^->":"Choices.0.0.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Absolutely.
