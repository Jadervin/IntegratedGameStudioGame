Still worn out from the magic incident?","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^No, well, I suppose in a new way, yes.","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^I have recovered from my incident with the assassin, but now I find myself in more mental turmoil.","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^Magic has been the center to this world, and now it's gone.","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^It makes me wonder, what would happen next?","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^We can no longer trust that those things we once considered normal will maintain.","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^And when that sense of normality is lost, the public is lost, too.","\n",{"#":"name Ariar"},{"#":"sprite Phone"},"^Hold on, friend.","\n",{"#":"name Ariar"},{"#":"sprite Phone"},"^We still have a while to fix things before we have to worry about the end of the world.","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^You have me all wrong, Ariar.","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^I'm not worried about the end of the world, I'm worried about the end of any perceived purposes in life.","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^People are not so quick to move on without a fight.","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^Perhaps this House War truly is inevitable.","\n",{"#":"name Ariar"},{"#":"sprite Phone"},"^We have known that a House War has been inevitable since the Houses were forged centuries ago.","\n",{"#":"name Ariar"},{"#":"sprite Phone"},"^All we can hope is that when it happens, the better of the people results.","\n",{"#":"name Ariar"},{"#":"sprite Phone"},"^War is undesirable, I agree, but when it does come, we can only hope that those who only live to cause tension and anger are the ones who are eradicated.","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^And we must also hope that all those who inhabit the world are safe.","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^Although, that much is not an easy goal to achieve.","\n",{"#":"name Ariar"},{"#":"sprite Phone"},"^Unfortunately, I think you're right.","\n",{"#":"name Ariar"},{"#":"sprite Phone"},"^The best purposes in life are often those most difficult to obtain.","\n",{"#":"name

GaledricIdle"},"^I don't know how aware you are of recent events, but given your profession and skill, I suspect you have heard about what happened a few days prior at the council, am I correct?","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^On that suspicion, you are correct, old friend.","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^How may I be of service to you?","\n",{"#":"name Galedric"},{"#":"sprite GaledricIdle"},"^Excellent, you are up to date, as expected.","\n",{"#":"name Galedric"},{"#":"sprite GaledricIdle"},"^I'm hoping you could assist me in some matters more under the table for now.","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^You know my methods, confidentiality is something I take pride in providing.","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^What are you looking for?","\n",{"#":"name Galedric"},{"#":"sprite

than others is that my house, House Ivy is to blame.","\n",{"#":"name Galedric"},{"#":"sprite GaledricIdle"},"^I was hoping that you would be able to provide some perspective, to investigate my house?","\n",{"#":"name Galedric"},{"#":"sprite GaledricIdle"},"^I fear that my words would fall upon deaf ears if I attempted to defend them, but you would not be as single-mindedly distrusted I would.","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^I can certainly do that for you.","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^Truth to be told, I was already planning on doing some snooping myself, something about the events that night just don't line up for me.","\n",{"#":"name Galedric"},{"#":"sprite GaledricIdle"},"^Excellent, but do tread carefully.","\n",{"#":"name Galedric"},{"#":"sprite GaledricIdle"},"^My house is not unaware of the suspicions against them.","\n",{"#":"name Galedric"},{"#":"sprite GaledricIdle"},"^Our borders are being tightened, and any trespassers are to be dealt with without impunity.","\n",{"#":"name Galedric"},{"#":"sprite GaledricIdle"},"^Even as an outsider to all houses, you would likely be regarded as a potential threat.","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^Good to know, Galedric.","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^You mentioned confidentiality, I presume you wish me to keep these activities a secret from your fellow house members as well?","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^Or is there another who I could trust on the inside?","\n",{"#":"name Galedric"},{"#":"sprite GaledricIdle"},"^I'm afraid that I'm the only one you'll be able to turn to once you're inside the borders, but I can't risk being too heavily associated.","\n",{"#":"name Galedric"},{"#":"sprite GaledricIdle"},"^I wish to make sure my house is not to blame for the degradation of magic, nor the attack at the council.","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^Then you can put your trust in me.","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^I shall uncover the truth, but know that if your house is responsible, I cannot simply withhold the truth from others.","\n",{"#":"name Galedric"},{"#":"sprite GaledricIdle"},"^I understand, but I know from the bottom of my heart that we are not responsible.","\n",{"#":"name Galedric"},{"#":"sprite
