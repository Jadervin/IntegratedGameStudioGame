Yeah, this is the place. Nobody around, what could be here that needs my help? This place couldn't be helped by House Holly on a good day.","\n","^The MC's phone begins to ring, and as they pick it up, they hear the voice of Ariar on the other end.","\n",{"#":"name Ariar"},"^Hey did you get to the place? Find anything yet?","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^Yeah, I found the place easy enough. Big warehouse, though looks as empty as the street that I had to take to get here. Find anything interesting about it with your research?","\n",{"#":"name Ariar"},"^Nothing yet. Built a few decades back, and hasn't seen commercial use in at least a few years. Now it's only used by the local kids and strays.","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^If this is another stolen cat I am going to explode.","\n",{"#":"name Ariar"},"^Don't worry, I checked the Zodiac board (Fantasy Facebook) first thing after you left.

Stay on the line, I'm going to check out the inside.","\n",{"#":"name Ariar"},"^Sure, keep me posted on any updates.","\n","^The MC moves into the interior of the warehouse, holding the phone just a breadth away from their face.","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^Nothing here, I think we just got a prank call out here.","\n","^As the MC lowers the phone to end the call, they are suddenly interrupted by a bolt of arcane energy streaking out from the rafters, striking their phone and sending it careening towards a wall, where it impacts with a resounding crunch.","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^Who is there? Show yourself!","\n","^A hooded figure, the Assassin, drops from their vantage point on the ceiling, landing on the floor like a fart on the wind. Silent, but deadly.","\n",{"#":"name Assassin"},"^You are a selfless fool, yet I envy your audacity.","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^What are you talking about? How dare you attack an investigator.","\n",{"#":"name Assassin"},"^You know the inevitability of a house war. Yet despite this knowledge you have chosen not to aid, but to stay away. You allow the world to crumble, the houses to be destroyed, then you are in charge of the world. No damage comes to you, yet the rest of us have to die. It is not right that the rest of us die in your absence. That's why you have to die instead.","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^In that case, I'll grant you a premature death.","\n",["done",{"#f":5,"#n":"g-0"}],null],"done",{"#f":1}],"listDefs":{}}
