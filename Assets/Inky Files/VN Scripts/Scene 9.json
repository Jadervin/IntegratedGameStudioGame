my comrade's loss of magic,","\n",{"#":"name Xzciar"},{"#":"sprite XzciarIdle"},"^but I didn't believe House Ivy was to blame,","\n",{"#":"name Xzciar"},{"#":"sprite XzciarIdle"},"^and yet this role

Galedric"},{"#":"sprite GaledricIdle"},"^news spreads quick.","\n",{"#":"name Galedric"},{"#":"sprite GaledricIdle"},"^The constables want to tear our office down one brick at a time after what you

learned anything from the recent events,","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^trying to be neutral and separate from all the houses means you're going to draw even more attention.","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^And this

saying...","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^Yes!","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^The initial council meeting fell apart because nobody bothered to trust each other or properly talk it out.","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^They were too busy throwing blame left and right.","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^What we need to do is organize a proper gathering where they don't spend all the time accusing the other houses of treason.","\n",{"#":"name Galedric"},{"#":"sprite GaledricIdle"},"^That is impossible.","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^I'm an optimist.","\n",{"#":"name Galedric"},{"#":"sprite GaledricIdle"},"^I maintain:","\n",{"#":"name Galedric"},{"#":"sprite GaledricIdle"},"^It is impossible.","\n",{"#":"name Xzciar"},{"#":"sprite XzciarIdle"},"^Not necessarily.","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^The Houses are far too busy looking for someone to blame.","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^House Ivy is taking the blame for something they had no hand in, and the first step towards stabilizing this situation is resolving that.","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^All the animosity has to stop, so we can start working towards a solution.","\n",{"#":"name Xzciar"},{"#":"sprite XzciarIdle"},"^I approve of this

with House Ivy.","\n",{"#":"name Galedric"},{"#":"sprite GaledricIdle"},"^They are more than willing to relieve themselves of this.","\n",{"#":"name MC"},"^Aether, I know it might be tough, but I'm going to need you to -","\n",{"#":"name Aether"},{"#":"sprite AetherIdle"},"^Finefinefinefine I'll do it!","\n",{"#":"name Aether"},{"#":"sprite AetherIdle"},"^If I can't convince Lady Klash, I know
